# Discord_Corona_Virus_Info_Bot_Commands
Code snippets for Corona Virus information retrievable through a few different analysis of the virus for use on discord (Skype would've been cool too but they stopped allowing bots on that last I checked pre-discord but should be easily modifiable). Code only, also all embeds we're stripped to prevent clutter.  If a code-base for a C# based discord bot is desired, github has no shortage.

Thank you to the people who work hard to keep this updated. 

and that was short lived because they're not updating this anymore and pointed to bad data sources. Looking for alts.
