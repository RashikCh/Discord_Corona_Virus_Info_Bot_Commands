# Discord_Corona_Virus_Info_Bot_Commands
Code snippets for Corona Virus information retrievable through a few different analysis of the virus for use on discord (Skype would've been cool too but they stopped allowing bots on that last I checked pre-discord but should be easily modifiable). Code only, also all embeds we're stripped to prevent clutter.  If a code-base for a C# based discord bot is desired, github has no shortage.
